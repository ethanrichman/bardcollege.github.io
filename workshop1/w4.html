    <h1>Is <a href = "view-source:http://bardcollege.github.io/workshop1/w4.html">Code</a> <code>Language</code>?</h1>

      I can't help but feel 2016 is too early a year for the phrase "code is regarded as the mediator of all human perception."  There is no doubt coding is currently an integral tool for "human-computer" relations and for its many applications in other sciences.  That said, coding is not nearly universally used or known about yet to be considered a unifying aspect of humanity.  Science fiction predicts a hypotehtical event called <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">The Singularity"</a> when humans merge with artificial intelligence creating a new unified race of super-intelligent, super-resilient beings.  Maybe <i>then</i> coding will be the new language, the new unifier.  Maybe then.

    <blockquote>
      "Presumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. His excursions may be more enjoyable if he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if they prove important."

<blockquote>“Finally, consciousness itself may end or vanish in a humanity that has become completely etherealized, losing the close-knit organism, becoming masses of atoms in space communicating by radiation, and ultimately perhaps resolving itself entirely into light. That may be an end or a beginning, but from here it is out of sight.” &mdash; John Desmond Bernal </blockquote>
