      I can't help but feel 2016 is too early a year for the phrase "code is regarded as the mediator of all human perception."  There is no doubt coding is currently an integral tool for "human-computer" relations and for its many applications in other sciences.  That said, coding is not nearly universally used or known about yet to be considered a unifying aspect of humanity.  Science fiction predicts a hypotehtical event called <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">The Singularity"</a> when humans merge with artificial intelligence creating a new unified race of super-intelligent, super-resilient beings.  Maybe <i>then</i> coding will be the new language, the new unifier.  Maybe then.

<blockquote>“Finally, consciousness itself may end or vanish in a humanity that has become completely etherealized, losing the close-knit organism, becoming masses of atoms in space communicating by radiation, and ultimately perhaps resolving itself entirely into light. That may be an end or a beginning, but from here it is out of sight.” &mdash; John Desmond Bernal </blockquote>
